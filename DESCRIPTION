Description: A quasi-simulation based approach to performing power analysis 
    for EWAS (Epigenome-wide association studies) with continuous or binary 
    outcomes. 'EpipwR' relies on empirical EWAS datasets to determine power 
    at specific sample sizes while keeping computational cost low. EpipwR can
    be run with a variety of standard statistical tests, controlling for either
    a false discovery rate or a family-wise type I error rate.
